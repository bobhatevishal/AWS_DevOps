## 🔐 NAT Gateway (NGW)

A **NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway** enables **outbound internet access** for instances in a **private subnet**, without allowing **inbound** traffic from the internet.

### 🔹 Key Points:
- Deployed in a **public subnet**
- Automatically scales
- **One-way** access: Private → Internet ✅, Internet → Private ❌
- Can be **managed (NAT Gateway)** or **self-hosted (NAT Instance)**

### ✅ Use Case:
- Allow private EC2s (e.g., database servers, app backends) to:
  - Download packages
  - Access external APIs

### 🧭 Route Table Example:

## 🔁 Summary Table:

| Feature              | Internet Gateway         | NAT Gateway                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Attached To**      | VPC                      | Public Subnet                    |
| **Used By**          | Public Subnets           | Private Subnets                  |
| **Inbound Traffic**  | ✅ (Allowed)              | ❌ (Blocked)                     |
| **Outbound Traffic** | ✅ (Allowed)              | ✅ (Allowed)                     |
| **Purpose**          | Full internet access     | Outbound-only internet access    |

## 💡 Pro Tip:
Always place the NAT Gateway in a **public subnet**, and ensure your private subnets route `0.0.0.0/0` to the NAT Gateway's **ENI** via the main route table (or a custom one).
